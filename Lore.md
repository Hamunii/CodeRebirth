Finally got the new computer working, after 3 years, took a bit, but we can finally document on a permanent source, something that can last longer. So this is where me(Dr. Steve Valentine), Dr. Lynn Mellor, Dr. Keith Dillon, and Dr. George Stuart can log our research.

While testing on Rapax-Folium, we discovered something interesting, the Rapax-Folium classified as RF-09, RF-09 appears to be around 70 years old, heavily expanding the age range of Rapax-Folium, it’s covered in foliage it produces itself, and it seems to be a lot more resilient then most Rapax-Folium. We are going to preform tests on RF-09, to see the limitations and strengths it has, harsh conditions such as direct sunlight, which is dangerously harmful to Rapax-Folium, Radiation exposure, burn test, the things that a normal Rapax-Folium wouldn’t be able to withstand.
