# Code:Rebirth
Overhaul mod for Lethal Company

## TODO List:

### Enemies
#### Concept: The Nuggets - Semi-Mobile Turrets
##### Description
The Nuggets are compact, semi-mobile turrets designed to blend seamlessly into their environment. They activate and emerge from the ground when detecting significant weight, opening fire with precise, long-range attacks.

##### Activation Mechanism
Activated by over 90 pounds of weight stationary above them, orienting towards vibration source to engage.

##### Fire Mode and Behavior
- **Firing Capabilities:** Narrow spread, long-range, slow damage rate.
- **Post-Fire Behavior:** If target not eliminated, either turn 180° and fire again or emerge fully and roam for new targets.

##### Secondary Activation
- Engages new targets found, then retracts to recharge. If no target, becomes dormant at new location.

##### Vulnerability and Defense
- **Durability:** Destroyable with two shovel hits; immune to knives and shotguns.
- **Defensive Reaction:** 360° firing spin if not destroyed by the first shovel hit.

##### Additional Characteristics
- Emits R2D2-esque sounds, adding a distinctive audio signature.

##### Strategic Implications
- More of a strategic nuisance than a threat, requiring mindful player movement.
